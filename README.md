# Task 3: Object Detection on Handwritten Numbers

Object detection is one of the main fields in object detection, on these last years substancial advances have been made to solve this problem using deep neural networks. This project will explore `RetinaNet` with the objective of detecting objects (handwritten digits) in an image (amount images in checks). 

To emulate the exact environment used for this project create a conda env using the `requirements.txt` file, running:

```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

All tests, source code and data manipulation are inside the `.ipynb` in this repo.
